Streams and creeks first overflowed their banks in Tioga and eastern Chemung counties late in the evening of the 1st.  Several road closures and bridge washouts were reported in these counties.  As the band of heavy rain shifted eastward during the night, flash flooding began shortly after midnight in most of the Susquehanna region.

Countywide stream and creek flooding hit Otsego county, with over a foot of water on roadways in the town of Hartwick.  In the Catskills, major stream and roadway flooding developed in the towns of Franklin and Claryville in southern Delaware and northern Sullivan counties respectively.  By midday on the 2nd, all area creeks and streams had receded back within their banks.

However, many locations above 2500 feet received 6 or more inches of snow.

The snow, which accumulated in a 3 to 4 hour period, covered many area highways, resulting in numerous accidents.  Two particularly hard-hit counties were Augusta and Rockingham.  The road problems were exacerbated by the fact that this was the first major snow of the season; few, if any, abrasives had been previously applied.  The event, which arrived at the tail end of the evening commute, snarled traffic and induced dozens of accidents.  A woman was killed when her vehicle flipped on icy roads in Craigsville (VAZ025).

Accumulations were highly dependent on elevation.  In general, western counties with mean elevations above 750 feet received 4 or 5 inches.  However, many locations above 2500 feet received 6 or more inches of snow.

The snow, which accumulated in a 3 to 4 hour period, covered many area highways, resulting in numerous accidents.  Two particularly hard-hit counties were Augusta and Rockingham.  The road problems were exacerbated by the fact that this was the first major snow of the season; few, if any, abrasives had been previously applied.  The event, which arrived at the tail end of the evening commute, snarled traffic and induced dozens of accidents.  A woman was killed when her vehicle flipped on icy roads in Craigsville (VAZ025).

As it quickly intensified and moved northeast (It passed just east of the New Jersey coast the morning of the 6th.), the precipitation associated with it changed from rain to snow across the higher terrain of the Poconos the evening of the 5th and over the higher terrain of northeast Berks County during the early morning of the 6th.  As the storm intensified during the early morning hours of the 6th, so did the precipitation.  The heaviest snow fell between about 2 a.m. and 8 a.m EST.  The snow also was very elevation dependent.  While heavy snow fell over the higher terrain, mainly just rain fell in Reading.  A mixture of rain and snow fell in Stroudsburg where less than one inch of snow accumulated.

Snowfall accumulations in Monroe County reached 19 inches in Tobyhanna and 15 inches in Mount Pocono.  The Mount Pocono borough had to declare a state of emergency after the heavy snow and jacknifed tractor trailers forced the closures of Interstates 80 and 380.  Traffic was diverted through the borough on Pennsylvania State Routes 611 and 940.  Dozens of weather related accidents were reported by state police throughout the Poconos.  Other snowfall accumulations included 13 inches in Long Pond, 11 inches in Pocono Lakes and 8 inches in Jundale in Carbon County.  The snow was heavy and very wet and pulled down numerous power lines.

The hardest hit locations within Monroe County were Blakeslee, Mount Pocono and Mountainhome.  There were still 800 homes without power as of 5 p.m. EST on the 7th.
